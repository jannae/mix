# Mix
Final project for HTML5 & Write Once Access Anywhere. (Spring 2011)

####Visit and Listen: <http://jann.ae/mix>
This project was an experimentation with the concepts learned in two classes covering HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, new techniques in javascript, and also Mobile Web Application Design and Development. 

At the time of conception, there was no Google Cloud, or iTunes match, or actually, any cloud-based music players at all other than a handful of mobile apps, but those didn't allow for the level of playlist customization that I felt I needed.

I've been making mixes for as long as I can remember, and sometime in early 2010, I started branding and distributing them.  They're mainly independent artists that I come across occasionally that I think other people should pay attention to.  However, sometime in late 2010, these mixes became so popular that I was spending entire weekends packaging, printing, and distributing them.  My hobby had become less of a fun thing to do for my friends, and more of a total time-suck nightmare.

Enter my mobile cloud player.
